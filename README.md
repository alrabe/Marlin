<img align="right" src="../../raw/1.1.x/buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/marlin-250.png" />

This is an adapted firmeware to support my upgraded Anet A6 printer.
Currently this features are supported

* Ramps 1.6plus board from BIGTREETECH
* connected MOSFET to D10 for Bed power (because of small connector- default is D8)
* connected Hotend to D8 (because of big connector - default was D10)
* connected Volcano Hotend (#5 - 100K thermistor - ATC Semitec)
* connected default Anet A6 LCD to ramps board (SD-Card support disabled)

# Comming soon:
* TMC 21300 drivers
* Bed Sensor
* Homing
